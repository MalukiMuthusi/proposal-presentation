    \frametitle{Problem Statement}

    Difficulty in travelling long distance journey in Kenya, due to high cost and unreliable services by public vehicles.

    There is a need to connect people who are willing to share their cars with
    passengers during travelling. Currently private car drivers fear driving to the    bus stations and pick passengers because they will spend a lot of time due to    congestion at bus stations.    In addition to that only authorized vehicles are    allowed to pick passengers at the bus stations.

    Passengers have a need to access private cars that are travelling from and to     their destination. They need this information earlier so that they can prepare     and plan their journey well
